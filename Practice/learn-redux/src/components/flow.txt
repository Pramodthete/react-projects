1) index.js:
Creates the Redux store using createStore from Redux, passing the combined reducer rootReducer as an argument.
Renders the App component wrapped in a Provider component, providing the Redux store to the entire application.

2) App.js:
Renders the HeaderContainer and four instances of HomeContainer.

3) HeaderContainer.js:
Connects the Header component to Redux.
Maps the cartItems state from the Redux store to the data prop in the Header component.

4) Header.js:
Receives props from HeaderContainer.
Displays the header with the title "E-Commerce" and the number of items in the cart (props.data.length).

5) HomeContainer.js:
Connects the Home component to Redux.
Maps the cartItems state from the Redux store to the data prop in the Home component.
Maps addToCartHandler and removeFromCartHandler dispatch functions to props.

6) Home.js:
Receives props from HomeContainer.
Displays a product with an image, name, price, and buttons to add/remove from the cart.
Dispatches addToCart or removeFromCart actions when the respective buttons are clicked.

7) actions.js:
Defines action creators addToCart and removeFromCart, each returning an action object with a type and data.

8) reducer.js:

Modifies the state based on dispatched actions (ADD_TO_CART and REMOVE_FROM_CART).

9) index.js (in the reducers directory):
Combines all reducers using combineReducers.
Exports the combined reducer.

This flow illustrates how each file in your Redux setup interacts with each other, from creating the Redux store to rendering components connected to Redux.
